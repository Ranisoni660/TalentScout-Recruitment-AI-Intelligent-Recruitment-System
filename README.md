Conversation Flow Design

The chatbot implements a sophisticated 10-state conversation machine:
python

ConversationState = {
    'GREETING': 'Initial welcome and purpose explanation',
    'COLLECTING_NAME': 'Full name collection with validation',
    'COLLECTING_EMAIL': 'Email validation and collection',
    'COLLECTING_PHONE': '10-digit phone number validation',
    'COLLECTING_EXPERIENCE': 'Years of experience validation',
    'COLLECTING_POSITION': 'Desired role collection',
    'COLLECTING_LOCATION': 'Location preferences',
    'COLLECTING_TECH_STACK': 'Tech skills categorization',
    'ASKING_QUESTIONS': 'Technical assessment',
    'COMPLETED': 'Screening completion'
}

Key Prompts Implemented
1. Greeting Prompt
python

SYSTEM_PROMPTS = {
    "greeting": "You are TalentScout AI Hiring Assistant. Greet candidates professionally and explain the screening process. Keep it warm but professional.",
    "fallback": "Provide helpful responses when you don't understand. Guide candidates back to the screening process."
}

2. Technical Question Generation
python

question_prompt = f"""
Generate 3-5 technical questions for a {experience_level} level candidate 
with {experience} years of experience.
Tech stack: {tech_stack}

Focus on practical, interview-relevant questions.
Difficulty: Appropriate for {experience_level} level.
Format: Each question on new line starting with 'Q:'
"""

3. Context Management
